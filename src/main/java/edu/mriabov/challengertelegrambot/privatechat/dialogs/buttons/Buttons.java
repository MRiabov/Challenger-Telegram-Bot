            I don't know what your addiction is, but it has to be treated. It is good, that you have stepped on a path of self-improvement,
            BUT!
            Addiction drags your self-image down. Each time you look in the mirror, you probably think:
            "Damn, how did I come to all of this? I don't even have that much fun from it, yet I still keep doing it.."
            And there is no thing more important than mental health and self-image, because it affects ALL your other areas of life. How can others treat you with respect if you yourself don't?
            There is a great book, "Atomic Habits"(+100k 5-star ratings on Amazon). It teaches how to avoid bad habits, as well as creating new ones. Highly recommend to read.
            I have quit all the "modern" addictions myself. The worst part about being a gamer, or a porn addict is that you don't even realise it's bad.
            And it's terribly bad.
            If you are a gamer, ask yourself, "Why compete in games, when I can compete in real life?"
            If you are a porn addict, ask yourself, "Why masturbate on women, when you can workout in the same time, improve your looks and just get women?"
            Addiction is a choice, you can either choose to get instant gratification, or you can do something meaningful in the same time.
